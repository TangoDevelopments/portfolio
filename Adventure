Now, since it was Kash's 10th birthday, he was old enough to have his own pokemans and leave his family to go catch and take advantage of the greatest pokemon out there. As he was setting out on his adventure, Professor Koa, a tall, hairy man approached him with a briefcase. He told Kash to take one of his pokeman balls.
